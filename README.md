# Fine-Tuning and Alignment Bootcamp

## About Fine-Tuning and Alignment Bootcamp

In this bootcamp, we explore advanced Fine-Tuning techniques and approaches to enhance Large Language Model performance, reduce their computational cost, with a focus on alignment with human values.


## Repository Structure
- [**data/**](./data/): Includes sample datasets or links to datasets used in the bootcamp, along with usage instructions. It also contains the implementation of dataset modules, or anything related to that.
- [**reference_implementations/**](./reference_implementations/): Reference Implementations are organized by topics. Each topic has its own directory containing codes, notebooks, and a README for guidance.
- [**utils/**](./utils/): It contains replicated codes or utility scripts that is used for the reference implementations.
- [**pyproject.toml**](./pyproject.toml): The `pyproject.toml` file in this repository configures various build system requirements and dependencies, centralizing project settings in a standardized format.

### Reference Implementations
- [**Distributed Training Demos**](./reference_implementations/distributed_demos/): Scripts demonstrating distributed training methods.
- [**Instruction Tuning Demo**](./reference_implementations/instruction_tuning_demo/): Jupyter notebook for instruction tuning techniques. 
- [**PEFT**](./reference_implementations/peft/): Custom modules and notebooks demonstrating Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques, with interactive sections for participant completion.
- [**Quantization**](./reference_implementations/quantization/): Notebook demonstrating model quantization techniques. 
- [**Supervised Fine-Tuning**](./reference_implementations/supervised_finetuning/): Notebook demonstrating supervised fine-tuning methods, with interactive sections for participant completion.



## Getting Started

To get started with this bootcamp:
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VectorInstitute/finetuning-and-alignment.git
```
2. Begin with each topic in the [`reference_implementations/`](./reference_implementations) directory. All reference implementations, except for the distributed training demo, have a corresponding notebook. Follow the instructions in the onboarding sessions to run these notebooks. For the distributed training demo, follow the instructions in its own README file.
